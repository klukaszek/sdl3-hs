-- Example     : GPUMultiWindowClear
-- Description : SDL Example: Clearing two windows with different colors using SDL_gpu
-- Copyright   : (c) Kyle Lukaszek, 2025
-- License     : BSD3
--
-- Based on the SDL_gpu_examples/ClearScreenMultiWindow C example.
-- Demonstrates creating two windows, claiming both for the same GPU device,
-- and clearing each with a distinct color within a single command buffer submission.
