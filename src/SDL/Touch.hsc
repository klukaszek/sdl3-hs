Module      : SDL.Touch
Description : SDL touch input management
Copyright   : (c) Kyle Lukaszek, 2025
License     : BSD3

SDL offers touch input management on platforms that support it, handling multiple touch devices
and tracking multiple fingers on those devices.

This module provides functions to query touch device information (e.g., 'sdlGetTouchDevices',
'sdlGetTouchDeviceName') and retrieve active finger data (e.g., 'sdlGetTouchFingers'). Touch
events are primarily handled through the SDL event system (SDL_EVENT_FINGER_DOWN, etc.), but
this module complements that by offering direct access to touch hardware details.

By default, SDL simulates mouse events from touch input, which can be identified by the
'SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID' constant. Applications needing to distinguish touch from mouse input should
filter out mouse events with this ID.
