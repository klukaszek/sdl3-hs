Module      : SDL.Version
Description : SDL version querying and management
Copyright   : (c) Kyle Lukaszek, 2025
License     : BSD3

SDL provides functionality to query the current SDL version, both as headers
the application was compiled against and as a library the application is linked to.

This module allows you to access the compile-time version of SDL through constants
and macros, as well as retrieve the runtime version and revision of the linked SDL
library. This is particularly useful when linking dynamically to SDL, where the
linked library version might differ from the version used at compile time.

The version information can be used to ensure compatibility or to log details for
debugging purposes.
